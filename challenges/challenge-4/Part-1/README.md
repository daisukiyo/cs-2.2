# Knap Sack Problem
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of 
capacity C to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
- *References* - Anne Spaldings CS 2.2 Lecture

### Input:
```
weight = [10, 20, 30, 15], value = [60, 100, 120, 70], capacity = 50
```
### Output:
```
The maximum value you can get is this: 230
```

### Dynamic Programming Steps taken
1. Identify the subproblems
    - Once we determine if an item should be in a Knap Sack, we check every combination of items with that and so on.
2. What does the solution roughly look like
    - The solution should return the highest value of items we can fit in our Knap Sack based on Capacity
3. Define a base case
    - The base case is if there are no items or the capacity is 0, return 0 for our value
4. Compute the value of an optimal solution (recurse and memoize)
    ```
    # Returns the maximum of two cases:
    # (1) nth item included
    # (2) not included
    return max(value[n-1] + knapSack(C-weight[n-1], weight, value, n-1), # Add it to the bag 
        knapSack(C, weight, value, n-1)) # or dont add it to the bag
    ```
5. Solve original problem - reconstruct from the sub-problems
